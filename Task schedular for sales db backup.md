In Windows, you can use Task Scheduler to set up a daily trigger for running your MySQL backup script. Here are step-by-step instructions:

Open Task Scheduler:

Press Win + S to open the search bar.
Type "Task Scheduler" and press Enter.
Create a Basic Task:

In the Actions Pane on the right-hand side, click on "Create Basic Task..."
Name and Description:

Enter a name and description for your task, then click "Next."
Trigger:

Choose "Daily" and click "Next."
Set the start date and time to today and 10:00 PM. Adjust the "Recur every" field to 1 day.
Click "Next."
Action:

Choose "Start a Program" and click "Next."
Browse and select the mysql or mysql.exe executable. This is usually located in the bin directory of your MySQL installation. The path may look something like C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe.
In the "Add arguments" field, enter the arguments needed to run your backup script. For example:
css
Copy code
-u your_username -p your_password -h localhost sales < C:\path\to\your\backup.sql
Replace your_username and your_password with your actual MySQL username and password, and adjust the path to your backup script.
Click "Next."
Summary:

Review your settings and click "Finish."
Adjust Task Settings (if needed):

After creating the task, find it in the Task Scheduler Library.
Right-click on your task and select "Properties" if you need to make any adjustments.
In the "General" tab, ensure that the task is set to run with the highest privileges.
Run the Task:

You can manually run the task by right-clicking on it in Task Scheduler and selecting "Run."
That's it! Your task is now scheduled to run daily at 10:00 PM. Make sure to test it by running it manually initially to ensure everything is set up correctly.
